### Steve Jobs

This is a fantastic book about the life of Steve Jobs - one of the most important man in digital products and animation movies. He is a very complicated man and a 100% genius with no doubt. Though you could argue he is not the one who invented Macintosh, you cannot deny he is the why apply exists and become so successful. He is a symbol of that age.

What surprises me is his unbelievable stubbornness which to some extent costs him life. But I cannot deny he might not succeed without his insistence. He would do anything to achieve what he believes is right and I think that’s why so many people admire him and become a loyal customer of apple.

Simple is the best but simple doesn’t mean stupid. In Steve Jobs’ eyes, the beauty comes as a whole. All apple products  are invented as a whole and refused to be dissembled. To have a beauty of simple, it is costing more than I could imagined. In addition to his sense of future, he knows a good product needs great advertisement to help. In one word, apple won’t succeed without their good design and tremendous marketing.

It is a great book to understand Steve Jobs and apple.
